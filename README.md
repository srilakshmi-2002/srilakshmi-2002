### ðŸš€ My Projects

**1. AuraTurbineAI: Predictive Maintenance Prototype**
   - **Goal:** To explore predictive maintenance for wind turbines using sensor data.
   - **Description:** This project is a proof-of-concept built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The initial plan was to build a supervised model, but the available dataset was unlabeled. The current prototype uses an anomaly detection approach to issue warnings for abnormal sensor readings.
   - **Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
   - **[View the Prototype on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lakshmisrii/AuraTurbineAI)**

**2. Interactive Image Augmentation Tool**
   - **Goal:** To create a simple tool to visualize common data augmentation techniques used in Computer Vision.
   - **Description:** This application allows users to upload an image and apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment to see the results instantly. It's a helpful utility for understanding how to expand a dataset for training deep learning models.
   - **Technology:** Python, Pillow, NumPy, Streamlit.

**3. EDA on Refrigerator Prices (from Web Scraping)**
   - **Goal:** To analyze the key factors that influence refrigerator prices on e-commerce websites.
   - **Description:** I scraped data for over 500 refrigerators and performed a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. One key finding was the significant impact of energy star ratings on price.
   - **Technology:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
   - **Note:** The code for this project is in a private repository as it is part of my ongoing learning.
